FlappyBird game made in python, made it ages ago but never created a repo

Its normal flappy bird with some different physics as I dont like the original physics though you can change 
some values to recreate, I also added a feature that lets you import images or a group of images, group makes it an animation 
and single image is... well just a single image.
