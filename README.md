A Python implementation of Flappy Bird with customizable physics and image support.

## Features

- **Custom Physics**: Modified from the original Flappy Bird physics (easily configurable to match original values)
- **Flexible Image System**:
  - Import single images for static sprites
  - Import multiple images for animated sprites
  - Automatic animation handling for image groups
- **Full Type Hints**: Practiced comprehensive type annotations throughout the project

## About

I developed this Flappy Bird clone some time ago but never published it. The physics are tweaked from the original game to feel better (in my opinion), though all values are adjustable if you prefer the original mechanics.

This project was also my exploration into Python type hinting - every function and variable has type annotations, though I haven't maintained this practice in other projects due to the time investment.
